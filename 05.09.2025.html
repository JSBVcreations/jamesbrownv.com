        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1">It was my dad’s birthday yesterday - he would have been turning 58 on 5/8. The number of the house I live in, coincidentally, is also 58.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">My dad was horrible about his health. Sometimes he’d lose weight, I think pretty much by accident; he was a tall guy, so he just carried it around in his belly and face. He had a sweet tooth, and Reeses’ Cups, Coke/Ginger ale, Lindzer tarts, and “Supreme” French bread pizzas were his weapons of choice. (Man - I am just now realizing it’s called a french bread pizza because it’s on french bread. I mean, I never didn’t know that? but I never put two and two together).</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">He didn’t exercise, and smoked cigarettes and weed and drank like crazy. He rarely, if ever, went to the doctor, which was ironic because he was also a hypochondriac. I think his oral hygiene was also lackluster, because he had horrible horrible tooth issues, especially later in life. I must have been 15 when he got a root canal (is that the name of an affliction? or a surgery? I guess people say “they’re having root canal surgery done”, so maybe it’s an affliction.) Anyway, he was laying on the floor screaming in pain in my parent’s bedroom, and he ended up slamming their door so hard the whole frame cracked. It remained cracked right up until my mom sold the house nineish years later.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">Over the past year or two, I’ve been getting on top of my health. Staying on top of it, actually. Not just diet and exercise, that’s honestly the easy stuff - no, I’ve been actually going to medical doctors, dentists, psychiatrists, the whole nine yards. There were a couple of years when Max was getting sick / dying where MY oral hygiene took a turn for the worse - I had never been great at flossing (as in, i never did), but my depression caught up with me and my bedtime routine for a while there was just smoking a spliff before bed. As it turn out, nine out of ten doctors said “what the fuck? in what world would that be a suitable replacement for brushing your teeth?” The tenth doctor got super high and forgot to respond.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">I had been on top of flossing and brushing by the time I finally got my dental cleaning / check up scheduled, but while there were no cavities I had some early stage gum disease to take care of. $1,200 dollars and four months later, I had a clean bill of dental health (stellar, actually) and a referral to the oral surgeon in the next unit over to take a look at some extra teeth I had.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">The extra teeth weren’t news - when I was 18 and having my wisdom teeth removed, they took x-rays and found out I had about a dozen “supranumeries” floating around my skull. They took them out with my wisdom teeth, and I got to keep them - but I guess they left two? I never really thought about it, until my dental hygenist made a comment / recommendation to have them taken care of.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">Which brings us to this morning, more specifically, right now, while I clamp down on some gauze to plug the cavities where my teeth used to be. Not that kind of cavity, the other kind, the kind they make you jump up and down to make sure you’re not smuggling contraband into the movie theatre.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">I saved $200 not getting an anesthetic or laughing gas, just a topical numbing agent and then headphones while the nurse held my head in place as the doctor popped the teeth out of my skull with pliers the way you would a corked bottle. It was about the same amount of force you’d use to open a jar of jelly that’s been sitting in the fridge for a few months: enough that if anyone were behind you, you’d give them a warning so you didn’t accidentally elbow them in the face. In my case, I was more nervous about her losing her grip and sending the pliers or scalpel or whatever tool she was using through my soft palette and into my brain. Which would have been an absolute waste, because then I’d lose my deposit on next week’s lobotomy.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="17">I have the teeth in a pouch on my desk right now; later I’ll put them in the tin where I have my old wisdom + extras. Maybe one day I’ll make a necklace, or epoxy them in a coaster, or even better, make a super fucked up taxidermy with human teeth. Separately from the brief concern the dentist was going to slip, it was pretty cool to feel the crunching / twisting / pulling as the teeth got pulled the same way you would handle a nail stuck in a piece of wood, or a bolt that’s been rusted shut. At a certain point, it was a mechanical problem, not a medical one - maybe Valvoline should start offering drive-through tooth extractions. Get your oil changed AND a root canal, no insurance needed.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="18" data-line-end="19">I would have saved $900 if I did it myself with pliers in the parking lot, but it was raining, and yes, they all laughed when I made that joke. They also laughed when I asked if my credit card declined, they were going to reverse-repo the teeth back into my mouth in the middle of the night, but since they made me pay up front I think that was less of a concern.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="20" data-line-end="21">It’s 11:11 as I glance at the time, which is perfect because I was about to slip into the synchronicity of it all. Yesterday, I was plagued with numeral coincidences, tons of recurring times and numbers and 58’s and 805’s and whatnots. Today, I reflected more on the full circle of what it actually looks like to take care of myself; something my dad never quite figured out how to do. I remember asking his sister’s and girlfriend after the funeral about him, trying to get a vibe on where he had been in his life in the years leading up to his suicide. Obviously it wasn’t great, considering; but I hadn’t spoken to my father for over four years, and I was curious.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="22" data-line-end="23">I asked about his health, and they all kind of chuckled; “not great”. He was in constant pain, a lot of it due to some serious dental issues that he just kept avoiding taking care of. There was other pain, as well, less specific but I can imagine. He was struggling financially, and had debt, which is ironic considering he was making well over 100k; but he lived beyond his means, and never saved, and was irresponsible overall with his spending - always had been.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="24" data-line-end="25">$2,500 is a lot to spend on dental care, even spread out over 8 months, but I’m proud of myself for not talking myself out of it due to sticker shock. Better to spend $2,500 investing in good health and pain-free oral care, than to ignore it and have to spend $15,000 and two years of agony later in life. Plus, isn’t this what they mean when they say “put your money where your mouth is?” But it’s more than just an economical decision. It’s a psychological one. I didn’t know what they’d find when I went in for the first consult last summer, just like even when I went in today I wasn’t sure how it would go. My inherited &amp; earned hypochondria is a fickle bitch, and likes to take a big game and then turn coward right before it’s time to show up. This consultation / surgery has been in the works for over six months, and after having to reschedule twice and postpone more than two months, I am so grateful and relieved to have it done.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="26" data-line-end="27">And not just because it’s over and done with - but because of what it represents. Facing my problems head on, valuing my health &amp; well-being as much as I value having a new computer or a Playstation, following through and showing up for myself where it counts, and doing what self-care <em>actually</em> means, not just what I decide to define it as. It’s not about “doing something my dad couldn’t do”, it’s about healing &amp; overcoming a generational / psychological wound that he both passed on, and held on to. Healing it not just for me, but for whatever spiritual thread connects us still.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="28" data-line-end="29">I’m not allowed to exercise or do any form of blood-pressure-raising exertion, which apparently includes going for walks. I did unironically ask the nurse about Fortnite, explaining that I occasionally get heart rate spikes (‘occasionally’); she said it was fine unless I noticed it become a serious issue. I guess we’ll find out. I wonder how different the games will go when I can’t micromanage my squad.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="30" data-line-end="31">I’m essentially bedridden for the next week, and while I bite down on the gauze for the next day or two I also can’t really talk that much. Maybe that’s why it was so easy to just immediately sit down and write. I feel like normally, I would take all these thoughts and realizations and spread them out over a series of phone calls with a variety of friends, rather than writing them down for myself (or for you, dear reader). Maybe there’s a lesson here on sitting in silence with myself before just dumping every thought I have into the social ether.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="32" data-line-end="33">Either way - I’m proud of myself for all the work I’ve put in over the last few years. Sometimes there are some issues you just have to deal with that daily maintenance won’t address. Whether that’s a systemic deep clean to get beyond the scope of what routine can’t fix, or a one-off investigative excavation to locate and yeet an inherited idiosyncrasy, it’s worth it. And no, I’m not just talking about my teeth. The theme of the last few months - the last few years - has been about not only recovering my daily habits and routines, and stepping back into the identity of someone who is healthy, happy, fulfilled, thriving, etc; it’s also been about recognizing that it’s not a failure or personal shortcoming to need specific and targeted corrections to take care of the hidden and long term impact of trauma, both old and new, as well as unaddressed subconscious and emotional blockages.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="34" data-line-end="35">Pride doesn’t really describe it either. I’m grateful - for the opportunity. It’s hard to believe things about ourselves that we have evidence to disprove. Sometimes, changing these beliefs is easier when we are faced with a much more extreme &amp; externalized manifestation. If you can overcome that challenge, that adversity, you can create new evidence to change the subconscious belief. For me - the belief that I am responsible for my health and well-being, that I value and care for all aspects of my health (physical, mental, emotional, spiritual); that I am in good health, I am healthy, and the future of my health is a good investment - that belief has been a long time in the making. The health anxiety that stemmed from my PTSD could not be confronted with positive affirmation any more than my extra teeth could have been removed by vigorous brushing (although maybe with a higher-grit toothbrush? Note to self: sandpaper toothbrushes - y/n?). No, affirmation could not resolve those intrusive thoughts / anxious beliefs - it took action, repeated and consistent, in opposition to the unhealthy beliefs, in order to create sufficient evidence necessary to override the trauma, and to create the proof that <strong>I</strong> needed in order to really FEEL as if I WAS and AM healthy, and not just temporarily, but as a function of my routine, my self-care, my taking care of all the mechanisms and processes and subroutines that go into Life and How to Live It.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="36" data-line-end="37">And now I’m grateful - that even though I am so so blessed to have so many wonderful friends I could have texted or shared any or all of this with (which I undoubtedly will, except now it’s going to be in PDF form instead of 100 disparate texts to a dozen people), instead I took the time to write, to be present, to distill and collect and purify instead of letting the condensation of experience to evaporate. I use social interactions as cheap calories when the action of emotional processing is too much - a crutch, a remnant of the days of Max’s illness and death. Not to say that there’s anything wrong with that - but I gotta make sure I get my protein. And in this case, that’s owing it to myself to create the space to really explore and capture. And then share and publish and discuss, of course.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="38" data-line-end="39">Ta ta for now. Gotta go swap my gauze.</p>
